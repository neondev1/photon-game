# Photon

A (terrible) sprite-less game cobbled together with OpenGL, originally conceived as a brief project but which ended up taking the entire summer to finish and costing a sizeable portion of my sanity along the way. Possibly my worst but still proudest creation.

## Instructions

Releases can probably be found under the "Releases" heading on the right-hand side of the page or [here](https://github.com/neondev1/photon-game/releases), if I actually remember to eventually add them. No installation required, but you should probably put the executable in its own directory.

If you want to build the binaries for Windows yourself, compile it in Visual Studio using the Release option. (I'm too lazy to get this to work with other IDEs/compilers or use CMake, and I'm sure you wouldn't want to use CMake either.)

If you're targeting another operating system, you'll also need to compile the binaries yourself; in that case, make sure that you are using C++17 and to link to `opengl32.a`/`libopengl.a`. You'll also need to compile your own `.a` files for GLFW; make sure to link the program statically when compiling and to accordingly build the correct version of GLFW. The source code of this program hopefully shouldn't contain anything Windows-specific, but I could be wrong.
