# Photon

A (terrible) sprite-less puzzle game cobbled together with OpenGL, originally conceived as a brief project but which ended up taking the entire summer to finish and costing a sizeable portion of my sanity along the way. Possibly my worst but still proudest creation.

## Instructions

Releases can probably be found under the "Releases" heading on the right-hand side of the page or [here](https://github.com/neondev1/photon-game/releases), if I actually remember to eventually add them. No installation is required, but you should probably put the executable in its own directory since it'll make some files and I'm sure you wouldn't want this game cluttering up your otherwise organized directories.

In any case, if you are compiling the binaries yourself, **make sure to exclude `editor/main.cpp` from compilation unless you are compiling the level editor.**

If you want to build the binaries for Windows yourself, compile it in Visual Studio using the Release option. (I'm too lazy to get this to work with other IDEs/compilers or use CMake, and I'm sure you wouldn't want to use CMake either.) If for some reason you want to build GLFW yourself using CMake, uncheck `USE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DLL`. (If statically linking the C++ runtime doesn't work, then change the runtime library setting to Multithreaded DLL (`/MD`) instead of Multithreaded (`/MT`)).

If you're targeting another operating system, you'll also need to compile the binaries yourself; in that case, make sure that you are using C++17 and to link to `opengl32.a`/`libopengl32.a`. You'll also need to compile your own `.a` files for GLFW; you might want to link the program statically when compiling and accordingly build the correct version of GLFW for static linkage if you do so. The source code of this program hopefully shouldn't contain anything Windows-specific, but I could be wrong.

## Level Editor

I'll probably include the level editor alongside [releases](https://github.com/neondev1/photon-game/releases) of the game.

To compile the level editor on Windows with MSVC, exclude the original `main.cpp` file from compilation and include `editor/main.cpp` instead. Both of these can be accomplished by selecting the corresponding file in Solution Explorer and changing the setting in Project > Properties.
